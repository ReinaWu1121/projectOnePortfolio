            <h3>Tyler the Creator</h3>

                <img src="img/tyler2.jpeg" alt="Tyler resting his head on his arm while wearing a black ushanka and cyan jacket"></a>
            <p>Tyler the Creator is primarily known for his rap and alternative hip hop music, but the cinematography of his music videos, general branding, and clothing lines features colors and compositions reminiscent of the works of Wes Anderson. His wild personality combined with his unique exploration of the arts inspires me to embrace the strange and see everything as potential subjects that can be designed upon.</p>

                <img src="img/wang2.jpg" alt="Black and white headshot of Wang wearing a t-shirt and glasses"></a>
            <p>Wang Zhi Hong is a book cover designer that primarily works with typography and simple imagery to create compositions that draws the attention of the viewer. While his works vary greatly in how they look, they all maintain a sense of carefully crafted balance that allows the surprising elements of his pieces to truly shine through. He inspires me to keep the fundamentals of gestalt theory at the forefront while also not being afraid to break the conventions when necessary.</p>

            <h3>Marina Abramovic</h3>
            <a href="https://www.mai.art/">
                <img src="img/marina2.jpg" alt="Black and white headshot of Marina wearing a dark button-up"></a>
            <p>Marina Abramovic is a performance artist that pushes the limits of the human body through her work, often putting herself in dangerous, tedious, and stressful situations to really communicate the message she is trying to send. The minimal design of her work inspires me to keep compositions simple when possible, as less can often speak louder than more, but to also push the boundaries of the conventions in design and see what new results can arise from it.</p>
