                    <p>Reina Wuu is a junior at San Francisco State University pursuing a degree in Visual Communication Designs after studying at Ohlone College for two years and Sacramento State University for one year. Currently residing in Fremont, Reina was born in Taiwan after immigrating to the United States when she was eight years old. Through her academic journey, she has produced posters, graphics, packaging, front matters, redesigns, style guides, typefaces, and many more. 
                    <br> <br>
                    In terms of design, Reina finds its best to have a wide understanding of the various disciplines within it. Typography, color, gestalt principles are all essential in forming a good foundation to design. Beyond that, topics such as technology, anthropology, and science all have their place in the world of design, as to be a graphic designer is to be multidisciplinary. In the future, Reina hopes to focus on identity design for companies and corporations, as she views the comprehensive work that goes with it to be engaging and invigorating. She also wishes that her designer skills are able to make a positive impact, even if it is only on the smallest scale.
                    <br> <br>
                    In her free time, Reina enjoys playing video games, cooking, photography, and fashion. She tries to explore as many creative avenues as possible to broaden her perspective and transfer it to the field of design and life. Reina believes that it is essential to have a strong understanding of oneself in order to produce the best possible design. As such, she works rigorously to face the music and try to find out the motivations of herself and the people around her. This website is dedicated to showcase some of her inspirations of favorite forms of media. Her inspirations consist of artists from all different walks of life, while her top five lists includes her favorite video game UI and animated movies.
