                <div class="description">
                    <p>I immigrated from Taiwan to the United States when I was 8 years old. Being an immigrant has its upsides, including being bilingual and having multiple cultural experiences, but it also has some downsides, mainly being that I am unable to see my extended family without committing a great amount of money and time to fly halfway across the world. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, cooking, photography, and fashion. Some of my favorite video games include The Binding of Isaac, Elden Ring, and the Persona series. I am currently a junior in San Francisco State University in the visual communication design program. I am interested in all things design because design is all around us. Everything from the chairs we sit on to the stores we enter are designed around both function and form. This subject is multidisciplinary and can involve topics ranging from technology to anthropology, it all depends on what the project is most suited towards. I hope to become a graphic designer one day that specifically focuses on identity design, as I feel like identity is a very important aspect to everyone, including companies and corporations, and I would love to be a part of the process that helps bring that identity to the forefront. </p>
